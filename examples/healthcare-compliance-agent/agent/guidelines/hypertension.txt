Title: Management of Essential Hypertension in Adults
Version: 2024.1

1. DIAGNOSIS
- Hypertension is defined as a persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg.
- Diagnosis should be confirmed by at least two readings on two separate occasions.

2. FIRST-LINE TREATMENT
- Lifestyle modifications: weight loss, DASH diet, sodium restriction (<2300mg/day), and regular aerobic exercise.
- Pharmacotherapy: ACE inhibitors (e.g., Lisinopril), ARBs (e.g., Losartan), Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Chlorthalidone), or Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., Amlodipine).

3. DOSING GUIDELINES
- Lisinopril: Start 10mg daily. Max 40mg daily.
- Amlodipine: Start 5mg daily. Max 10mg daily.

4. CONTRAINDICATIONS
- ACE inhibitors and ARBs are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy.
- Avoid non-selective beta-blockers in patients with reactive airway disease (asthma).

5. ESCALATION
- If goal BP (<130/80 mmHg) is not reached within 1 month, increase dose or add a second agent from a different class.
