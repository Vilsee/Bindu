# Contributing to the Healthcare Compliance Agent

This agent is designed to be a "dot" of value in the Bindu ecosystem. To maintain the high level of clinical safety and compliance, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

## 🛡️ Compliance Standards
- **Zero Hallucination**: Every new feature or disease protocol must be backed by a verified `.txt` file in `agent/guidelines/`.
- **Traceability**: All responses must return an `audit_id` generated by the `AuditLogger`.
- **Privacy**: No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) should ever be logged in the immutable ledger.

## 🤝 Collaborative Reasoning
When adding specialized medical categories (e.g., Surgery, Oncology):
1. Create a specialized sub-agent metadata.
2. Update the `handle_message` method in `main.py` to initiate an A2A call to the new specialist for high-complexity queries.

## 💰 Economic Logic (X402)
- Ensure every clinical suggestion has a corresponding cost associated in `agent_config.json`.
- Payments are handled via USDC on Base; ensure the `total_bill` logic is updated if new diagnostic tiers are added.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] Integration with real-time PubMed API for automated guideline verification.
- [ ] Multi-sig audit verification for high-risk surgical decisions.
- [ ] Direct Bindu-Pay integration for clinician reimbursement.
